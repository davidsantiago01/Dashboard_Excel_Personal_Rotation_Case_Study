## Project Overview 

### Case Study
You are a newly hired analyst for the human resources department at SelvaCongo.com, a company that sells everything online. They currently have a problem with how information about the hiring and firing of their warehouse staff across the country is displayed. The previous analyst had to prepare PowerPoint reports for more than 100 different managers and department heads, which
took up more than half of their time each month. SelvaCongo.com is also concerned about its staff turnover rates and wants managers to have this information at their fingertips so they can reduce them below the industry average.
The company has decided to invest in a new software solution to automate this process. 

### Task

- Amount of revenue
- Number of locations/performance as a percentage of revenue
- Number of releases/performance as a percentage of revenue
- Staff turnover rate (defined as departures over revenue)
- 2 graphs
- 2 segmenters
- 1 table
